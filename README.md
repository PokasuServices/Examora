# Examora Platform

AI-powered exam preparation and mentoring platform for design/fashion/architecture/aptitude
entrance exams. Governed by [`documents/00_Master_Development_Guide_Examora_Platform_MDG-00.docx`](documents/00_Master_Development_Guide_Examora_Platform_MDG-00.docx).

## Status

**Sprint 5 — Creative Assignment Engine (complete).** Admins author assignments (brief, file
rules, marks, rubric criteria, deadline) directly or from a reusable template (copied — not
live-linked — at creation time) and publish once ≥1 rubric criterion exists. Students upload files
via presigned direct-to-storage URLs; every file is quarantined (`PENDING`) until an async ClamAV
scan marks it `CLEAN` — only then does it ever resolve a download URL, and an `INFECTED` file is
deleted from storage immediately. Each resubmission is a new versioned row, never an in-place edit.
Admins assign a MENTOR/REVIEWER-role reviewer per submission; the reviewer scores every rubric
criterion, leaves comments, and publishes an APPROVED/REVISION_REQUESTED decision that closes out
the submission and notifies the student via the shared comment thread. Full admin (authoring,
monitoring, reviewer workspace) and student (catalog, submission, history) UIs ship this sprint.
Builds on Sprint 4 (Assessment & Quiz Engine: question bank, quiz authoring, timed autosaving
attempts, automatic scoring, attempt monitoring), Sprint 3 (Learning Engine: published-only catalog,
lesson viewer/completion, progress dashboard, no enrollment gate), Sprint 2 (Course Management: the
`Category → Course → Subject → Topic → Module → Lesson` content hierarchy, DRAFT/PUBLISHED/ARCHIVED
workflow, CRUD/reorder APIs, admin content UI), and Sprint 1 (Authentication & Identity:
registration, email verification, login/logout, refresh rotation, password reset, sessions, RBAC +
permissions, profiles, Google OAuth, consent, audit). Positional image annotations on rubric review
(CREATIVE-10 §7) are explicitly deferred. Mentoring, community, notifications, payments, analytics,
AI and further CMS enhancements are not started. See
[`docs/roadmap/SPRINT_BACKLOG.md`](docs/roadmap/SPRINT_BACKLOG.md) for the full plan.

> Malware scanning and object storage run against real ClamAV/S3-compatible (MinIO) adapters in
> dev/prod, but every automated test uses fake in-memory adapters instead (ADR-0015) — the real
> adapters are only manually verified, not CI-covered (TD-027).

> Email is not actually delivered yet — Sprint 1 uses a console-logging mailer stub (ADR-0009);
> verification/reset tokens appear in the `apps/api` logs. Real delivery arrives with the
> Notification Service in Sprint 9.

### First administrator

Self-registration only ever grants the STUDENT role. To create the first administrator, promote a
registered user directly in the database:

```sql
UPDATE user_roles SET role_id = (SELECT id FROM roles WHERE name = 'ADMINISTRATOR')
WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'you@example.com');
```

Then re-login to pick up the new role, and visit the admin app at http://localhost:3002.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20 (see `.nvmrc`)
- pnpm >= 9 (`corepack enable` will pick up the pinned version from `package.json#packageManager`)
- Docker + Docker Compose (for local Postgres/Redis/MinIO)

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env          # fill in local values
docker compose up -d          # starts Postgres, Redis, MinIO (add `clamav` too for real malware scanning — optional, see TD-027)
pnpm db:migrate                # applies Prisma migrations
pnpm dev                       # runs api (3001), web (3000), admin (3002) in parallel
```

- API: http://localhost:3001/api/v1, Swagger at http://localhost:3001/api/docs, health at
  http://localhost:3001/health
- Web: http://localhost:3000
- Admin: http://localhost:3002
- MinIO console: http://localhost:9001

## Common Commands

```bash
pnpm build          # build all workspaces
pnpm lint            # lint all workspaces
pnpm typecheck       # typecheck all workspaces
pnpm test            # unit/integration tests
pnpm format          # format with Prettier
pnpm changeset       # record a changeset for a change
pnpm db:studio       # open Prisma Studio
```

## Engineering Standards

All contributors (human or AI) must follow `documents/00_Master_Development_Guide_Examora_Platform_MDG-00.docx`
and the checklists in `docs/DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLIST.md`. Every feature requires backend, frontend,
database migration, tests, Swagger documentation, RBAC enforcement, and audit logging — see
MDG-00 §21 (Feature Workflow) and §19 (Definition of Done).
